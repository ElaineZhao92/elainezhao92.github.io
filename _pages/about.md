Hi! I’m Yilei Zhao (Elaine), currently a Ph.D. student at Nanyang Technological University, where I am fortunate to be advised by <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=K2CHjf0AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao'>Wei Yang Bryan Lim</a>. Prior to joining NTU, I completed my bachelor’s degree at Zhejiang University, where I had a wonderful academic journey that sparked my interest in research.

My research primarily focuses on Fintech (AI4Finance). I have worked on applying deep learning models to tackle financial tasks, including portfolio management and algorithmic trading. Currently, my interests extend to foundation models, particularly in making them trustworthy for real-world applications. I am especially interested in topics such as uncertainty quantification, explainability, and ensuring that these large-scale models can be deployed reliably in high-stakes decision-making environments.
